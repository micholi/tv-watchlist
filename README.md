# TV Watchlist - Flatiron School Sinatra Portfolio Project

TV Watchlist is a CRUD application built with Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord. After logging in, or setting up a new account, a user can create, read, update, and delete TV shows. When a user creates a new TV show, it will automatically be added to his or her personalized watchlist. In addition, users can browse shows, networks, and users to find other shows to add to their watchlist, however they won't be able to edit or permanently delete any shows that were created by someone else.
